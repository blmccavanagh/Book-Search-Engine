## Development

### Web development technologies

Development of the project was centered around using Apollo and graphQL with the use of MongoDB/Mongoose ODM, back end web applications for Node.js that are installed using the node package manager (NPM).

The application is deployed to Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud..

Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.
