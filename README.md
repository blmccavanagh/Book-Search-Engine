## Development

### Web development technologies

Development of the project was centered around using Express and MongoDB/Mongoose ODM, back end web applications for Node.js that are installed using the node package manager (NPM).

The application is deployed to Heroku, a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud..

Node.js, an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.

Compression is Node.js middleware used to compress response bodies.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

Lite-server is a lightweight development only node server that serves a web app, opens it in the browser, refreshes when html or javascript change, injects CSS changes using sockets, and has a fallback page when a route is not found.

MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

### Challenges

While I had previously used Heroku for some of my other applications, the specific implementation for a MongoDB based application was also a recent area of learning. I required an understanding of how to link a Git repository to my Heroku instance, and the database specific connection strings required to start an instance of MongoDB within the Heroku cloud.
